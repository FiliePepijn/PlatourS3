          <p class="intro" style="--index: 2;">
            For the fast forward week we made Holo Sports, for this assignment I had to create something that will be revolutionary in the future. At first we were struggling to pick between the sports, food and entertainment category.
            So we looked at which one we liked the most and this was the sports category. 
          </p>

        <div class="detail-text">
          <h2>
            Research 
          </h2>
          <p style="--index: 3;">
            With the sports category in mind I started doing <a href="/docs/LO3/HoloSports.pdf" target="_blank" class="link">Reserach</a> on current problems in sports or things that can help an athlete achieve better results.
            I looked at google scholar research for problems in sports. But I didn't really find anything.
          </p>
          <p style="--index: 4;">
            But then I thought of using AI and Holograms in sports. The idea is that you can race against your hologram. This will keep you motivated to continuously break your own records.
            And you can race against other athletes as well to see if you can beat the best of the best.

          </h2>
          <p style="--index: 5;">
            To visualise this we made a sketch of the idea, and then I made the track with the laser cutter from the makerspace.
            On the right you see the final product, with the running track, and the projector lines.
            We made the hologram of tape and straws, and the projector from a straw and bubble plastic.

            For the portfolio assignment I had to create a portfolio that shows my work and who I am. I started with the design of the portfolio. I wanted to make it look clean and professional. In this section I will show you how I created my portfolio and explain the choises i made.

            Inspiration
          </h2>
          <p style="--index: 3;">
            Before I started with creating my portfolio I looked at ideas from others which I thought would look good and would represent myself as a designer the best. 
            I have two websites as inspiration for my portfolio. 
            <a class="link" href="https://prism-on.tokyo/prism/">PRISM</a> and 
            <a class="link" href="https://www.francobollimontilessini.com/poster/monte-tomba">Monte Tomba</a>

          <h2>
            WireFrame
          </h2>
          <p style="--index: 5;">

            When I had my inspiration I started with the wireframe of the portfolio. I made a wireframe on paper. This to make a more efficient layout of the learning outcome, and use elements of my inspiration websites.
            And by creating a paper prototype I had a more flexible way of putting my elements on a different spot. By making it on paper it gives more of a visual look.

            Colors
          </h2>
          <p class="intro" style="--index: 6;">
            After creating a wireframe I started with choosing the colours o
            f my portfolio. I know I want the matt colours from the inspiration I did.
            On the right you will see the colors I used for my portfolio.
          </p>

          <h4>DarkBlue #222831</h4>
          <p style="--index: 7;">
            I chose this colour because it provides a good base, 
            i can use it as a text colour or for small elements. 
            Because of the slight blue tint it feels very modern.
          </p>

          <h4>Beige #EED9C4</h4>
          <p>
            The soft beige colour compliments the darker text and it can be used for 
            background sections. It adds a cosy vibe to my portfolio.
          </p>

          <h4>Red #F05454</h4>
          <p>
            I want to use a red colour since i love red or tints of red. 
            It really stands out, warns the user of something. 
            I will use this for the background of my portfolio 
            with the beige as text to give it a warm/cosy vibe.
          </p>

          <h4>Blue #22AED1</h4>
          <p>
            This colour makes my whole site look more fresh, 
            I can give certain elements highlights and make them stand out. 
            Such as icons, titles and links.
          </p>

          <p>
            With these colors together I can make several different combinations
            to make my portfolio look more professional and clean.

            Design
          </h2>
          <p style="--index: 2;">
            After creating the wireframe and choosing the colors I started with the design of the portfolio. I used the colors from the color scheme. 
            The design proces was really fun and easy to do because I had a clear vision of what I wanted to make.
            I only got stuck on the color combination of what collor should be the background and what color should be the text.

          <p>
            For the client project we had to create a studio, so we created Solaria Design.
            We had to create a logo, a brand story, brand guide and a Video.
            Below i will show you what and how we created Solaria Design.

            Brand
          </h2>
          <p>
            For our brand we needed to create a brand story, so my team mates and i started writing down our core values.
            We put them on a board and started brainstorming about what we wanted to do with our brand.
            We saw soon that we are all adventurous and we love to explore the world.
            So we came up with the idea of Solaria Design, a studio that finds and explores people spark.

            <p>
              After we had our brand story I started with the logo. I wanted to make a logo that represented all of our core values.
              because we all like to explore i wanted to something with landscapes, like mountains or the sea. These are all things you see when you go exploring.
              Then I made a <a class="link" target="_blank" href="">figma</a> and finalised the logo in illustrator.

            <p>
              For the video I came up with the idea of our group standing in a space ship
              and we are flying through space. We are looking for the spark of people.
              in the video we say who we are and what we do. We also show our logo and stickers.
              We made the video in the video lab at fontys R10.

              For the video in the videolab we used the pixel playground for wich i made the 3d enviroment.
              In unreal engine i made the space ship were we would be standing.

            <p>
              I had a lot of fun making the video, but I also had struggles.
              For example I didn't have a storyboard so I didn't know what to film.
              and I didn't have a really clear vision of what we wanted to make.
              Overall I am really proud of the result.

          In the first week I made (with my group) a concept for the furture in the FastForward week.<br>
          When we got the assignment I started searching for current problems that could be solved trough technoligy.<br>
          I found various problems in different categories, but the one that stood out to me was the sports category.<br>
          I got inspired by the fact that the sports industry is growing rapidly and that there are many problems that can be solved with technoligy.<br>
        
        </p>
        <p style="--index: 3;">
          <br>
          I started to think about how we could solve these problems and came up with the idea of Holograms in sports.
          This way altheletes can train more efficiently, they can for example race againt a their own hologram or the hologram of someone else.<br>

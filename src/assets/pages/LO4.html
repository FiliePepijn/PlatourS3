            Scrum
          </h1>
          <p class="intro" style="--index: 2;">
            In our client project we used the Scrum method. 
            Scrum is a framework that helps teams work together. 
            Much like a rugby team (where it gets its name) training for the big game, 
            Scrum encourages teams to learn through experiences, 
            self-organize while working on a problem, 
            and reflect on their wins and losses to continuously improve.

            Roles
          </h2>
          <p style="--index: 3;">
            In the Scrum method there are several roles. 
            The roles in our team are: Scrum master, Ux designer, Ui designer, Front-end developer, Client/Stakeholder.
            
            The Client/stakholder is responsible for providing the vision of the product and the requirements.
            The Scrum Master is responsible for taking care of every one doing their tasks and following 
            The scrum board for wich we used <a class="link" href="">Notion</a>.

            Sprint Planning
          </h2>
          <p style="--index: 4;">
            For the our scrum I as scrum master had to plan the sprints and make sure that the team was on track.
            At first i had no idea how to make a sprint planning and assign the tasks to the sprints.
            So I aske a teacher for help and he helped me to make a sprint planning and how to assign the tasks to the sprints.

                Voor het maken van een sprint planning kan je het project het best opdelen in 
                verschilldende onderwerpen van de double diamond.
                Dus verdeel de 12 weken over bijvoorbeeld 6 sprints.
                en ga dan kijken naar welk onderwerp je aan elke sprint koppelt.
                Dan kan je ook de deliverables voor elke sprint bepalen op deze manier 
                kan je de backlog en to-do list voor elke sprint opstellen.

              Double Diamond
            </h2>
            <p>
              To plan the sprints I used the double diamond methods as dirk sugested.
              The double diamond is a method to divide the project into different parts.
              The double diamond has 4 steps: Discover, Define, Develop, Deliver.

          <p class="intro" style="--index: 2;">
            For the portfolio assignment I had to create a portfolio that shows my work and who I am. I started with the design of the portfolio. I wanted to make it look clean and professional. In this section I will show you how I created my portfolio and explain the choises i made.

            Inspiration
          </h2>
          <p style="--index: 3;">
            <br>
Before I started with creating my portfolio I looked at ideas from others which I thought would look good and would represent
 myself as a designer the best. I have two websites as inspiration for my portfolio. 
 <a class="link" href="https://prism-on.tokyo/prism/">PRISM</a> and <a class="link" href="https://www.francobollimontilessini.com/poster/monte-tomba">Monte Tomba</a>

            WireFrame
          </h2>
          <p style="--index: 5;">
            <br>
            When I had my inspiration I started with the wireframe of the portfolio. I made a wireframe on paper. This to make a more efficient layout of the learning outcome, and use elements of my inspiration websites.
            And by creating a paper prototype I had a more flexible way of putting my elements on a different spot. By making it on paper it gives more of a visual look.

            Colors
          </h2>
          <p class="intro" style="--index: 6;">
            After creating a wireframe I started with choosing the colours o
            f my portfolio. I know I want the matt colours from the inspiration I did.
            On the right you will see the colors I used for my portfolio.
          </p>

          <h4>DarkBlue #222831</h4>
          <p style="--index: 7;">
            I chose this colour because it provides a good base, 
            i can use it as a text colour or for small elements. 
            Because of the slight blue tint it feels very modern.
          </p>

          <h4>Beige #EED9C4</h4>
          <p>
            The soft beige colour compliments the darker text and it can be used for 
            background sections. It adds a cosy vibe to my portfolio.
          </p>

          <h4>Red #F05454</h4>
          <p>
            I want to use a red colour since i love red or tints of red. 
            It really stands out, warns the user of something. 
            I will use this for the background of my portfolio 
            with the beige as text to give it a warm/cosy vibe.
          </p>

          <h4>Blue #22AED1</h4>
          <p>
            This colour makes my whole site look more fresh, 
            I can give certain elements highlights and make them stand out. 
            Such as icons, titles and links.
          </p>

          <p>
            <br>
            With these colors together I can make several different combinations
            to make my portfolio look more professional and clean.

            <br>
            After creating the wireframe and choosing the colors I started with the design of the portfolio. I used the colors from the color scheme. 
            The design proces was really fun and easy to do because I had a clear vision of what I wanted to make.
            I only got stuck on the color combination of what collor should be the background and what color should be the text.

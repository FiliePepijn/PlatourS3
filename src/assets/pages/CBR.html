          For the Client Project every group had to choose a client and make something for them.
          All the stakeholders came by at fontys to do a briefing about the problem or issue 
          that they had and what they wanted us to make for them.
          after all the briefings the groups had to choose a client as stakeholder.

            For choosing the client I went to the briefings of the stakeholders and listened
            to what there problem was and they wanted us to make for them.
            After all the briefings I made a list of the clients that I liked the most.
            The rest of my group made a list as well and we compared the lists.

            After we heard that we got the CBR project from Partout. We were excited to start creating and gathering research. The first weeks were the most difficult because it was hard to make a beginning on the project, we didn’t really know where to begin. But then we started with doing a debrief.

          <p>
            After we got the briefing from Partout I made a debrief to get all the information in one document. And sent it to the client to check in if our thoughts about the assignments matched. The client reacted that the debrief was good and he had the same idea about the assignment. Here is a link to the debrief Partout Debrief.
            When we got the Idea of what the assignment was, we started doing research and asked ourselves “what is the real problem that drives students don’t pass the exam.”
            We started doing research, for the research I made a market analysis and made a survey for the target audience.
